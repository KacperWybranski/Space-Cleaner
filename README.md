# Space-Cleaner
My first SceneKit game with spaceship destroying debris :)

Main purpose of this project was to start working with 3d graphics and get to known SceneKit, also this was my first project I considered as a thing I want to include in my portfolio.

I was working on it for 2 weekend now and I can say that it's done with logic and some basic design and haptic responses I wanted to implement, however there're no sounds at all, but in my opinion it's not that important if I don't try to public it to appstore.
